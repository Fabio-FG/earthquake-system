## Design Decisions
- Used a restricted color palette that I thought would look clean, modern and minimalist.
- Responsive first.

**color palette**
- **main colour**: ![#160f2e](https://placehold.co/15x15/160f2e/160f2e.png) `#160f2e`
- **main text colour**: ![#00bba7](https://placehold.co/15x15/00bba7/00bba7.png) `#00bba7`



## Challenges
- Handling big data sets;
- Component renderization hierarchy;
- Map constraints (zoom causing header to disappear, out of bounds handling)

## Limitations
- Using Leaflet.js does not allow for 3D rendering. Mapbox would be fitting for this but due to time constraint I opted to use Leaflet.
- Pagination constraints would conflict between the List component and the Map component. Therefore, this feature was put on the Backlog for future improvements.


## Backlog (Future Improvements)
- [ ] Add unit tests (e.g: Jest)
- [ ] Add Components such as Pagination to the Earthquake list and Drawer to improve UX when selecting a Marker.
- [ ] Refactor the renderization hierarchy
